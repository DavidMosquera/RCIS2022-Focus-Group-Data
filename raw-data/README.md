# "Raw" data and data refinement
We collected the contributions from each focus group session. The data as written by the subjects went through two refinement processes. The first refinement process was discussed among the researchers to synthesize the contributions, relate them to each other, and find conflicts. The second refinement process was discussed again with the researchers to further synthesize the contributions for presenting results in the paper (see Section 4). 
You can review each refinement process from the raw data to the way it was presented in the paper at the following links: 
* [RQ1](https://github.com/DavidMosquera/RCIS2022-Focus-Group-Data/tree/main/raw-data/RQ1): What are the challenges perceived by MDD users during modeling for later code generation?  
* [RQ2](https://github.com/DavidMosquera/RCIS2022-Focus-Group-Data/tree/main/raw-data/RQ2): What are the features of the current modeling assistants that users like/dislike? 
* [RQ3](https://github.com/DavidMosquera/RCIS2022-Focus-Group-Data/tree/main/raw-data/RQ3): What are the userâ€™s needs that are unsatisfied by the current modeling assistants?
