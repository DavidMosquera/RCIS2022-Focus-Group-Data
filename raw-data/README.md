# "Raw" data and data refinement
we collected the contributions from each focus group. The data as written by the subjects went through two refinement processes. The first refinement process was discussed among the researchers to synthesize the contributions, relate them to each other, and find conflicts. The second refinement process was discussed again with the researchers to further synthesize the contributions for presentation in the article. 
You can review each refinement process from the raw data to the way it was presented in the paper at the following links: 
* RQ1 
* RQ2 
* RQ3
