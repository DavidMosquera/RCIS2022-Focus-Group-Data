# RCIS2022 Focus Group Data

### This repository provides focus group protocol, threads of validity, and “raw” data of the paper entitled “Assisted-Modeling Requirements for Model-Driven Development Tools”, submitted to the 16th International Conference on Research Challenges in Information Science (RCIS2022), authored by D. Mosquera, M. Ruiz, O. Pastor, and J. Spielberger.

# Protocol
## Defining the research problem
This sections is already in the paper. As summary, we would like to answer three research questions: (RQ1) What are the challenges perceived by MDD users during modeling for later code generation? (RQ2) What are the features of the current modeling assistants that users like/dislike? and (RQ3) What are the user’s needs that are unsatisfied by the current modeling assistants? For more information, consult paper's Section 3.1.

## Selecting subjects
This sections is already in the paper. As summary, we select MDD users as focus group participants by proposing three types of MDD users based on literature: (Type A) non-IT related business level users, (Type B) IT level users not strictly related to modeling , and (Type C) IT level users strictly related to modeling. All subjects of our focus group should fit in one of the proposed MDD user types. For more information, consult paper's Section 3.2.

## Segmentation
This section is already in the paper, however, we include all the raw data related to demographics in the repository. As summary, we conduct two focus groups composed by similar subjects. Group I is composed by less experienced MDD users and Group II is composed by wide experienced MDD users. We show raw demographics in the following subjesctions. Moreover, for more information consult paper's Section 3.3. 

### Group I

## Conducting the focus group
This sections is already in the paper, however, we deeply explain the World Café discussion method configuration in the repository. As sumary, we follow the World Café method in order to guide the discussion during the focus group. We show the configuration in following subsections. Moreover, for more information consult paper's Section 3.4. 
### Set the context
Initially, moderators set the focus group context introducing and clarifying the purpose of the focus group. Such context setting takes 10 to 15 min for explaining the goals and challenges which the dialogue will unfold. 
### Create hospitable space
We conduct the focus groups on welcoming and safe environments nurturing personal comfort and mutual respect. The sessions will be held physically—if possible due to the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions—in the halls and facilities of the Zurich University of Applied Sciences. Such facilities are equipped with tables, chairs, food, and other infrastructure that are part of the wellcoming and safe environment. 
### Explore questions that matter
The main objective of conducting the focus group is gather data for answering the research questions defined in Section 3.1. Although we already proposed such questions, we specify them further to focus the collective attention, having as a result a set of main questions for each research question as shown in Table 3.

### Encourage everyone’s contribution 
Each SMQ will be discussed following a brainstorming-like strategy, first participants generate ideas to answer the SMQ, then participants evaluate each question by discussing, improving, and refining its content. We expect to enliven the relationship between the “me” and the “we” in the focus groups following this strategy.  
### Cross-pollinate and connect diverse perspectives
Moderators will maintain the diversity and density of connections among participant’s perspectives for facing the SMQ, grasping substantial discussions quickly and paraphrase participants points to ensure the contributions are correctly understood. However, moderators should not allow his or her own opinions to influence the discussion. 
### Listen together for patterns, insights, and deeper questions 
At the end of each focus group session, moderators summarize the contributions on each SMQ wrapping all the discussed ideas. Up to this point, participant questions could arise and, also, more contributions. The moderators document all the remaining contributions nurturing coherence of thought without losing individual contributions.

## Data capturing
We capture the focus group data before, during, and after the focus group session. We specify all data we will gather as follows: 
* Before the focus group session: Participants will answer a set of demographic questions in order to characterize them.
* During the focus group session: The moderator will take notes about the focus group session. Such notes can contain participants’ doubts, comments, and other feedback about the SMQs. In addition, participants will write their contributions on post-its.
* After the focus group session: The moderator will collect questions, comments, or contributions at the end of the focus group session.
