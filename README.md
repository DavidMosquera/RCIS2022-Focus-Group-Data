# RCIS2022 Focus Group Data

### This repository provides focus group protocol, threads of validity, and “raw” data of the paper entitled “Assisted-Modeling Requirements for Model-Driven Development Tools”, submitted to the 16th International Conference on Research Challenges in Information Science (RCIS2022), authored by D. Mosquera, M. Ruiz, O. Pastor, and J. Spielberger.

# Threats of validity
In this section, we explore possible threats to validity that our focus group may raise. We use what Wohlin et al. (2012) discuss in their book titled "Experimentation in Software Engineering."
## Conclusion Validity
### Low statistical power
We conduct the focus groups by using a set of 14 subjects, lowering the statistical power due to a little sample of population. Moreover, focus group is a qualitative data method and not quantitative data. We plan to replicate this experiment in the future, having more data from more subjects we will mitigate this threat. 

### Random heterogeneity of subjects
We conduct two focus groups, comprising subjects with similar backgrounds and contexts. Group I comprises students between 3rd and 4th year of their undergraduate studies. All of them are part of the same undergraduate course where the focus group takes place. They are less experienced MDD users. On the other hand, Group II comprises software engineering practitioners from the same enterprise (Posity AG). They have wide experience not only in industry but also using MDD tools. Therefore, we mitigate the risk of having very heterogeneous subjects in the focus groups, having such segmentation.

## Internal Validity
### Maturation
Focus group sessions are 2 to 3 hours long. So, subjects' contributions could be affected negatively because subjects get tired or bored during the session. We select World Café discussion method in order to mitigate this threat: "a simple yet powerful conversational process that help groups of all sizes to engage in constructive dialogue." Such method have a set of steps for avoiding subject get bored and tired during sessions, including setting the context, creating a hospitable space, exploring questions that matter, encouraging everyone's contribution, cross-pollinating and connecting diverse perspectives, and listening together for patterns, insights, and deeper questions. We deeply discuss each configuration step of World Café method [here](https://github.com/DavidMosquera/RCIS2022-Focus-Group-Data/tree/main/protocol#conducting-the-focus-group). 

### Instrumentation
Badly designed instruments for collecting data can affect the focus group negatively. We design all instruments for collecting data based on guidelines found in the literature to mitigate this threat. Furthermore, we conduct a pilot of this focus group comprising two software engineering practitioners, two lecturers and researchers, and one MSc student at the Zürich University of Applied Sciences. All of them are not subjects of the reported focus groups. We validate and improve our instruments for gathering data based on their feedback. 

## Construct Validity
### Evaluation apprehension
Group I subjects can arise this threat, since they are part of a undergraduate course and they are maybe afraid of being evaluated. Therefore, we clarify that the focus group activity have no grade in the undergraduate course, keeping all contributions and demographics anonymous in order to mitigate this threat.

### Experimenter expectancies
Experimenters can bias the result of a study both consciously and unconsciously based on they expectations from the experiment. We mitigate this threat involving different roles in the research team. The first author acted as the focus group moderator, having the second author supervising him. Then, last two authors reviewed the results and analysis obtained from the experiment. 

## External Validity
### Interaction of selection and treatment
Having the wrong people participating in the experiment could affect negatively the experiment results. Therefore, we defined a set of MDD user types ([here](https://github.com/DavidMosquera/RCIS2022-Focus-Group-Data/tree/main/protocol#selecting-subjects)) in order to mitigate this threat. Subjects involved in the focus groups must fit one of such types, allowing us to generalize the results in the future when we replicate the experiment.
