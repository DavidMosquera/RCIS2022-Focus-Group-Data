# RCIS2022 Focus Group Data

### This repository provides focus group protocol, threads of validity, and “raw” data of the paper entitled “Assisted-Modeling Requirements for Model-Driven Development Tools”, submitted to the 16th International Conference on Research Challenges in Information Science (RCIS2022), authored by D. Mosquera, M. Ruiz, O. Pastor, and J. Spielberger.

# Threats of validity
In this section, we explore possible threats to validity that our focus group may raise. We use what Wohlin et al. (2012) discuss in their book titled "Experimentation in Software Engineering."
## Conclusion Validity
### Low statistical power
We conduct the focus groups by using a set of 14 subjects, lowering the representative results due to a little sample of population. Moreover, focus group is a qualitative data method and not quantitative data. Therefore, the focus group have a low statistical power. We plan to replicate this experiment in the future, having more data from more subjects we will mitigate this threat. 

### Random heterogenety of subjects
We conduct two focus groups, comprising subjects with similar backgrounds and contexts. Group I comrpise students between 3rd and 4th year of their undergraduate studies. All of them are part of the same undergraduate course where the focus group takes place. They are less experienced MDD users. On the other hand, Group II comprise software engineering practitioners from the same enterprise (Posity AG). They have wide experience not only in industry but also using MDD tools. Therefore, we mitigate the risk of having very heterogeneous subjects in the focus groups, having such configuration.  

## Internal Validity
### Maturation
Focus group sessions are 2 to 3 hours long. So, subjects' contributions could be affected negatively because they get tired or bored during the session. We select World Café discussion method in order to mitigate this threat: "a simple yet powerful conversational process that help groups of all sizes to engage in constructive dialogue." Such method have a set of steps for avoiding subject get bored and tired during sessions, including setting the context, creating a hospitable space, exploring questions that matter, encouraging everiyone's contribution, cross-polinating and connecting diverse perspectives, and listening toghether for patterns, insights, and deeper questions. We deeply discuss each configuration step of World Café method [here](https://github.com/DavidMosquera/RCIS2022-Focus-Group-Data/tree/main/protocol#conducting-the-focus-group).
