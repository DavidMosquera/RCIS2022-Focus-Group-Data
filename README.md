# RCIS2022 Focus Group Data

### This repository provides focus group protocol, threads of validity, and “raw” data of the paper entitled “Assisted-Modeling Requirements for Model-Driven Development Tools”, submitted to the 16th International Conference on Research Challenges in Information Science (RCIS2022), authored by D. Mosquera, M. Ruiz, O. Pastor, and J. Spielberger.

## Repository Overview
We created this repository to show data that, for space reasons, is not included in the paper "Assisted-Modeling Requirements for Model-Driven Development Tools." In addition, we hope that including this repository will show transparency in the data obtained and the experiment performed, allowing other researchers to access the data and protocol for further analysis and replication of the experiment in other scenarios. This repository is divided into three sections: 
* [Focus group protocol](https://github.com/DavidMosquera/RCIS2022-Focus-Group-Data/tree/main/protocol): We attach the entire focus group protocol that we designed. This protocol allows us to replicate the experiment in other settings and obtain more data. In particular, we added data that were not included in the article in the following sections of the protocol: [segmentation](https://github.com/DavidMosquera/RCIS2022-Focus-Group-Data/tree/main/protocol#segmentation), [conducting the focus group](https://github.com/DavidMosquera/RCIS2022-Focus-Group-Data/tree/main/protocol#conducting-the-focus-group), and [data capturing](https://github.com/DavidMosquera/RCIS2022-Focus-Group-Data/tree/main/protocol#data-capturing). 
* [Threats of validity](https://github.com/DavidMosquera/RCIS2022-Focus-Group-Data/tree/main/threats-of-validity): We analyze some threats of validity related to our experiment. Such anlysis include: [conclusion validity](https://github.com/DavidMosquera/RCIS2022-Focus-Group-Data/tree/main/threats-of-validity#conclusion-validity), [internal validity](https://github.com/DavidMosquera/RCIS2022-Focus-Group-Data/tree/main/threats-of-validity#internal-validity), [construct validity](https://github.com/DavidMosquera/RCIS2022-Focus-Group-Data/tree/main/threats-of-validity#internal-validity), and [external validity](https://github.com/DavidMosquera/RCIS2022-Focus-Group-Data/tree/main/threats-of-validity#internal-validity). 
* [Raw data](https://github.com/DavidMosquera/RCIS2022-Focus-Group-Data/tree/main/raw-data): We show the "raw" data of our focus group. Moreover, we show how group's contributions have been refinated for presenting them in the paper.
