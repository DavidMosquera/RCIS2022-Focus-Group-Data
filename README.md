# RCIS2022 Focus Group Data

### This repository provides focus group protocol, threads of validity, and “raw” data of the paper entitled “Assisted-Modeling Requirements for Model-Driven Development Tools”, submitted to the 16th International Conference on Research Challenges in Information Science (RCIS2022), authored by D. Mosquera, M. Ruiz, O. Pastor, and J. Spielberger.

# Protocol
## Define the research problem
This sections is already in the paper. As summary, we would like to answer three research questions: (RQ1) What are the challenges perceived by MDD users during modeling for later code generation? (RQ2) What are the features of the current modeling assistants that users like/dislike? and (RQ3) What are the user’s needs that are unsatisfied by the current modeling assistants? For more information, consult paper's Section 3.1.

## Selecting subjects
This sections is already in the paper. As summary, we select MDD users as focus group participants by proposing three types of MDD users based on literature: (Type A) non-IT related business level users, (Type B) IT level users not strictly related to modeling , and (Type C) IT level users strictly related to modeling. All subjects of our focus group should fit in one of the proposed MDD user types. For more information, consult paper's Section 3.2.

## Segmentation
This section is already in the paper, however, we include all the raw data related to demographics in the repository. As summary, we conduct two focus groups composed by similar subjects. Group I is composed by less experienced MDD users and Group II is composed by wide experienced MDD users. We show raw demographics in the following subjesctions. Moreover, for more information consult paper's Section 3.3.
